<h1>Welcome to the Imperial Space Station Tide !</h1>

These are the glorious days<br> 
of the Empire. Although the <br>
Death Star has been destroyed,<br>
Imperial troops have driven<br>
the Syndicate forces from their <br>
hidden base and pursued them <br>
across the galaxy. <br><br>

On the Imperial Space Station<br> 
Tide meanwhile, Imperial Law<br>
is strictly enforced. Its <br>
personnel works tirelessly <br>
together to ensure the might<br>
and prosperity of the Empire.<br><br>

Lately though, rumours have <br>
reached the ears of the command <br>
staff that the cowardly rebels <br>
are planning to infiltrate the<br>
station and hinder the Empires<br>
quest for rightful domination.<br><br>

Are any of these rumours true?<br><br>
Time will tell...
